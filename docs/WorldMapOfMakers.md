# World Map of Makers

Create a simple internet connected application to query the status of a web API and use that information to toggle an LED.

[Each pin on this map](https://adafruitsample.azurewebsites.net/cardViewer?lesson=201) is another maker that has run this sample. Zoom around to see where they are and deploy the sample to put your pin on the map!
